### Avatar Communication

Avatars on each screen can communicate with each other via webSocket (socket.io).
Mutual communication is possible between multiple PCs connected to the network (one PC as the server + client avatar, others as client avatars).  
However, the communication channel is not encrypted.

Do you want to enable the Socket.io communication functionality/server functionality?
(You can change the on/off settings and port number later.)
