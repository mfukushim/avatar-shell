Since the system is somewhat complex, this guide will walk you through the key features step by step.  
If you don't need assistance, feel free to close this and configure it on your own.

1. Setting up the Gemini LLM
2. Setting up the avatar

This system is designed to integrate image and audio generation with text generated by LLMs.  
Therefore, in this tutorial, we will use the Gemini API as an example, as it provides unified support for image and audio generation.

The system also supports OpenAIâ€™s image and audio generation, ComfyUI API, VoiceVox API, and more, so once you understand the basics, feel free to try other APIs as well.  
Currently, LLM configuration supports OpenAI, Anthropic and gemini. Support for local LLMs via the Ollama API and other LLM APIs is also in development.
