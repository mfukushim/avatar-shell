1. Setting up the Gemini LLM
2. Setting up the avatar

This system is designed to integrate image and audio generation with text generated by LLMs.  
Therefore, in this tutorial, we will use the Gemini API as an example, as it provides unified support for image and audio generation.

It also supports openAI conversation/image generation/speech generation and Claude conversation.  
Currently, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini are supported for LLM configuration, and other APIs such as Ollama API, ComfyUI API, and VoiceVox API are under consideration for local LLM.
