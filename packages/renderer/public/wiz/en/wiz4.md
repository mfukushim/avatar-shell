Set the avatar template for the tutorial using the gamini API key you received.

### Saving the avatar template

In this system, we will create an avatar template setting for common settings for each dialogue screen.

The avatar template saves settings specific to the avatar. In this tutorial, we will set the following values.

- Default avatar name for the created screen  
  Temporally
- Main LLM to be used  
  gemini
- Definition of behavior at startup, behavior after a certain period of time, and behavior during specific conversations (context daemon)  
  Automatically executes basic greetings for tutorials (images, audio)
- MCP permission settings  
  Off (Not use MCP. Not use built-in MCP either)
- Avatar communication settings  

Set the following options (Local communication only or Off)

When you perform an operation to add a screen (clone an avatar), a new avatar screen is created using the avatar template settings.

Avatar screen logs and generated content are managed per avatar template, not per individual avatar.


If you want to create an avatar template with these settings, proceed to the next step.
(Settings can be changed later)
